Hi! Welcome to my Portfolio

![Ash Weston Portfolio ](ashwestonhome.gif)

Here, you can read a little bit about me, and follow links to my Github, Linked In and Resume.

This is a work in progress – I am currently completing my full stack course through the University of Adelaide and will continue to update my “work in progress” projects.

Hover over each project to be taken to the deployed application. (I have purposefully chosen to use fun/colorful images instead of screen shots of the application for design purposes. All applications can also be accessed via my Github profile.)

I’ve included a contact me page, which will be updated at a later stage for functionality purposes.

Technologies used for this project:

bulma - https://bulma.io

Jquery - https://jquery.com/
